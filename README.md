# LiveChess

This is my entry in Phoenix Phrenzy, showing off what Phoenix and LiveView can do.

Play chess against the Stockfish 10 chess engine. This application uses Chex. I chess library and OTP application I wrote for the purpose of this app. Together they use Elixir Ports, OTP, UCI (Universal Chess Interface), Phoenix and Phoenix Live View to play chess live in a web browser.

[Demo here](https://chess.alecho.com/)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Configure [Chex](https://github.com/alecho/chex) to point to your Stockfish binary
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser!
